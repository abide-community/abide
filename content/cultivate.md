David-Chad Svenson is the director of Cultivate, a ministry devoted to developing people, plans, and prayer support to grow God's Kingdom. He began working with Cultivate in the summer of 2013 because of his heart for discipleship and men’s ministry, as well as his gift for shepherding and teaching. He has helped Cultivate develop trainings and classes, while also mentoring several young men through one-on-one relationships and men’s small groups. He now leads a team of volunteer mentors and student leaders who endeavor to transform the people of Oakland University into kingdom workers.

Cultivate believes that if a person or team welcomes God, listens to the specific plan he gives, and becomes supported in prayer by others who are asking God for support, then God’s Kingdom can grow anywhere, into the heart of any person.
