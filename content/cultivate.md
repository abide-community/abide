Cam Underdown is a pastor and director of Cultivate, a ministry devoted to developing people, plans, and prayer support to grow God's Kingdom. 

Cultivate looks for people who are desiring to move the kingdom of God forward, and serve them in any way possible. Maybe it’s starting a brand new endeavor with a visionary college student to meet an injustice. Maybe it’s partnering with an existing ministry to build a new team that will help that ministry meet its next God-given goal. Maybe it’s working through a difficult addiction or past issue with a Christian student to get that person ready for kingdom service. Maybe it’s praying with the leaders of a local church for God to reveal ways to make deeper connections with its immediate neighborhood or global outreach. If there’s a person, plan, or prayer network that needs to be developed to advance the kingdom, Cultivate desires to assist in furthering that work.
