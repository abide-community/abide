Transplanters enables synergy between foundations and pioneering non-profit leaders.  These leaders are pioneers because they sacrifice everything in pursuit of their innovative ideas. Transplanters serves these leaders by performing development services including grant writing and consulting on organizational structure, systems and priorities. 

In addition, Transplanters serves foundations by providing exceptional project management and reporting, as well as the opportunity to align with well-managed, highly-influential non-profits.  

Dave and Kris McKenney developed the skills that shape Transplanters while performing award-winning service for Habitat for Humanity affiliates around the country in various volunteer, board, and staff positions. They now bring that knowledge, passion, and management to pioneering leaders in their local community of metro Detroit, and beyond.
