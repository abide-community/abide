Abide is a community of people who are praying and working towards being one in Christ. It is our desire to love the Lord our God with all of our heart, soul, mind, and strength and love our neighbor as we love ourselves. 

We are a community amongst and within other communities. We go about our daily lives with the intent of being faithful to God and encouraging others to do the same. By community, we mean families and individuals located throughout the world connected by the Holy Spirit and like mindedness who share in the friendship and brotherhood of Jesus Christ. We do not necessarily attend the same church or live in the same city yet we share the same Lord. Jesus told his followers, “Now you are my friends, since I have told you everything the Father told me.” (John 15:15 NLT). We strive to be such friends as this. It is our privilege as a community to encourage others to abide in God - the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. We do not follow a prescribed method or logic; rather, we point people to Jesus and help them hear from God and be trusting and obedient to what He is doing in and through their life. This is a life long endeavor - to abide. We know that God's desire for everyone is to love the Lord their God with all of their heart, soul, mind and strength and to love their neighbor. To love God and love others is the basis of abiding. Practically speaking, Abide Ministries is a 501c3 religious non-profit committed to the strengthening of families in Jesus.
