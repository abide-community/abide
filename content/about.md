### WHAT IT MEANS TO ABIDE

In the last few years, Abide Ministries has expanded its reach by helping to start and sustain new initiatives that help people intimately know the love of God. Taken together, these initiatives are known as the Abide Collective. Some collective ministries serve human trafficking victims, others semi-professional athletes, individual and community needs through art and reconciliation, and still others international students, helping each person they encounter to hear from God just as we desire to do.
