We believe that God works through individuals and teams to accomplish his purposes in the world - who we call kingdom workers. These people need well-established Christlike character to effectively love the people who they are called to love by God and advance his Kingdom in their lives. Through prayer, education, mentoring, and hands-on training, we at Cultivate develop people to grow Godâ€™s Kingdom.
