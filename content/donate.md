## Help us help others.

As the Abide Collective has grown, we at Abide Ministries realize how important it is for us to be able to help our Collective members as much as we can. We have such a diverse group of families and individuals doing work in a variety of contexts, some of whom struggle to find the necessary funds to do the important and meaningful work that Jesus has given them to do. The Abide General Fund is set up to receive gifts so that we can serve collective members, especially those who can use it the most. Gifts made to our general fund go toward services like coaching costs, grant writing, and can even become direct gifts made to Collective members who are just getting started. When you give to the Abide General Fund, you can trust your gift will go where it matters most.
