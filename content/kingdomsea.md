Empowering and equipping Christians to help others follow Jesus and make disciples of all the nations is at the heart of Kingdom Sea. 

With a heart for individuals of all nations, Kingdom Sea looks to inspire Christians to create intentional friendships and mentorships with the people of all backgrounds and ethnicities, including international students in their own geographic area. 

Discipleship begins with authentic relationships and being intentional to reach out to and come alongside others. Through strategic outreaches, encouraging intentional friendships, prayer, and training and development, Kingdom Sea hopes to empower new leaders looking to inspire global change through loving one’s neighbor and serving as the hands and feet of Christ.

Impacting the nations and aiming to “see the kingdom come” is at the heart of Kingdom Sea, as relationships are formed with both American and international friends that will impact their lives through spiritual, intentional conversations that speak truth and light into future global leaders.
