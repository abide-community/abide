bio: Abide Ministries and the Abide Collective are made up of an extremely diverse group of people, each with a unique set of gifts and relationships. It's a large task to ensure that every gift that comes in is accounted for, every paycheck is sent, and every issue of compliance handled properly. This is where Chelsea comes in, and she does a brilliant job.<br><br>An entrepreneur herself, Chelsea is a rock-solid administrator who makes life for everyone within Abide easy, and for that, she is well loved by everyone she works with. When she's not running her own business or the finances and accounting for Abide, you can find her driving her Jeep through the wildnerness or getting to know her neighborhood in the city of Detroit better.
