      <description>WHAT IT MEANS TO ABIDE We are a community amongst and within other communities. We go about our daily lives with the intent of being faithful to God and encouraging others to do the same.
By community, we mean families and individuals located throughout the world connected by the Holy Spirit and like mindedness who share in the friendship and brotherhood of Jesus Christ. We do not necessarily attend the same church or live in the same city yet we share the same Lord.</description>

      <description>Over several years, Donna McCauley has developed friendships with men and women on the streets of Detroit and families who need encouragement in their faith. Donna, along with her 70x7 team of friends who have a long term commitment to encouraging others, spend time with these individuals and families on a weekly basis. Encouragement is given in the form of friendship, dignity, bible study, prayer and the meeting of a few basic needs, all with the view of helping individuals and families navigate away from at-risk activities and toward Jesus.</description>

      <description>For over 20 years, Mike and Robyn Carnill have committed their lives to strengthening the relationships of others with Jesus, which is the basis of Abide. Whether it happens through one-on-one discipleship, prayer, solitude retreats, deep friendships, or some other way, Mike and Robyn desire to see anyone who is willing to listen to Jesus come to live more fully in him.
Throughout its history, Abide has changed and grown, reminiscent of the vine growing from the branch that Jesus desires our lives to be.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The question I am asked most often when speaking about hunger, war, trafficking, disease, or poverty is, What can I do? I’ve never been asked, Who must I become? Doing justice well is important, but who we become is equally — if not more — important.&amp;rdquo;
Stephan Bauman
In a world filled with brokenness, it&amp;rsquo;s simply not enough to want to help. The world is filled with people who have a desire to assist their neighbor in loving and meaningful ways, and yet so many of these goodhearted people lack the resources, skills, education, and time to serve their neighbor in meaningful, effective ways.</description>

      <description>This world often feels like a battle between us and them. We look for people who are like us, who look like us, who like what we would like, and who make us feel comfortable. Meanwhile, we are constantly categorizing the people who don’t fit the definition of us as “them”. “Them” is whoever is not like us, for all the reasons that we believe. Whether conscious or unconscious, we are looking for ways to define our world so we know the difference between us and them.</description>

      <description>In the spring of 2018, Charli Carnill felt the call of Jesus to leave her collegiate softball career and community of friends at Cornerstone University in order to offer herself as a servant to those suffering the effects of poverty and injustice all over the world. While a vessel describes any container which carries something, Charli&amp;rsquo;s desire is to be a vessel which carries the love of Christ to those who may be struggling to find it.</description>
